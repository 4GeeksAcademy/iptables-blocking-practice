# `03` Validate your work

This step consists of running a verification script to validate what is required in this practice. Follow these steps:

## 1. Run the script

On the desktop of your Debian machine, download this file [check-ip-tables.sh](https://github.com/breatheco-de/iptables-blocking-practice/blob/master/.learn/assets/check-ip-tables.sh).

Navigate to the directory where the check-ip-tables.sh script is located. You can use the cd command to change directories. For example, if the script is in the Documents folder, you should run:

```sh
cd ~/Documents
```

Make the script executable (if it is not already). This can be done using the chmod command:

```sh
chmod +x check-ip-tables.sh
```

Run the script by specifying the script name. You can also provide any necessary arguments. Assuming no additional arguments are needed for this example, you should run:

```sh
./check-ip-tables.sh
```

## 2. Upload your results

Running the script will create a file named report.json that you must upload as the solution to this project.

## 3. Done!

You have now created a NAT network in VirtualBox and connected a Debian virtual machine and a Windows virtual machine to each other using this network. This way, you can experiment with scenarios that test your cybersecurity skills.

If you have any problems, do not hesitate to contact a mentor or the other support channels offered by 4Geeks.
